# Table Component Test

In this post, we'll test the custom `Table` component. The `Table` component is designed to render data given an object containing headers and rows. Below, you can see an example usage:

| Foo | Baz |
|-----|-----|
| Bar | Qux |

Feel free to experiment with the data object to further test the component!
